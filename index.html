              "On the first day of my Intro to Computer Science class, the professor...actually got up in front of the lecture hall and outright TOLD the women in the class that they should drop the class. Because, they're just going to drop out of the program anyway and meanwhile they're preventing a guy from being there who would see the program through, and it's important to these guys' careers. I am not exaggerating even a little.
              That intro class was about 40% women. Almost all of us dropped the class immediately, not because we thought we couldn't hack the work or weren't interested — we wouldn't have signed up for it in that case — but because we felt certain that no matter how well we performed, that professor was going to find a way to screw us over."

            <div class="col-xs-12 maintext">Once women do earn their computer science degrees,
              they often find it difficult to break into the field and stay there. Eliza Brock,
              a developer who teaches at Nashville Software School and runs her own software company,
              attributes part of the problem to the recent emphasis on 'culture fit' in hiring.
              While the bias is often unconscious, the phrasing can become a barrier of entry to women and
              minorities when employers hire those they could most easily picture hanging out with in the breakroom.

              women's shaky self-confidence, according to Vivek Wadhwa, a Silicon Valley investor,
              diversity coach and author of <i>Innovating Women</i>. For example, Google's own data showed
              women were promoted less often than men because workers need to nominate themselves. Women
              who did so got pushback as they were rewarded for modesty and penalized for what men viewed
              as aggressive behavior. However, once Google began including female leaders at workshops to
              coach everyone on how to promote themselves effectively, the gender difference among nominees disappeared.</div>

          Many attribute the difficulty women face to sexism that persists throughout the field where 96% of venture
          capital firm partners are male. The threat of harassment is an obstacle for women seeking venture capital and
          many female entrepreneurs avoid meeting VCs in spaces such bars and hotel lobbies, where men frequently meet one another
          to discuss potential deals. According to Wadhwa, many venture capitalists have an idea

        <div class="col-xs-12 maintext">Beyond the economic implications, diversity in a tech staff also leads to a greater
          range of products that serve everybody. For example, when Apple launched its health tracker in early 2015, it
          omitted women's menstrual cycles, relied upon by couples trying to conceive, from the service. And as recently
          as 2011, Apple's Siri could find prostitutes and Viagara, but not abortion providers.</br></br>
          Diversity also improves individual and business performance. One 2006 study showed that groups with more racial
          diversity outperformed groups with no racial diversity because being with similar people leads us to believe we
          all share the same perspective. The study also found that when we hear dissent from someone who is different than us,
          it provokes more thought than when it comes from someone who looks like us. In business, a 2014 study showed that
          gender-balanced organizations perform better financially and demonstrate superior team dynamics and productivity.
          A 2014 report by the Kauffman Foundation found that female-run startups produce a <strong>31%</strong> higher
          return than startups run by men.

                  In 2013, Google, whose engineers are 17% female, introduced a training program designed to fight cultural biases.
                  Employees play word games and are surprised to find they quickly link engineering professions with men and less
                  technical jobs with women.

            “We are in a major time of shift. There is no other time when women have been better educated, earning a majority
            of undergraduate and graduate degrees and serving in equal numbers in nearly all professions. The control of personal
            wealth is about equal, as baby boomer men are dying earlier and women are inheriting money from their parents and
            husbands and have their own assets from working. If we can access 2 percent of that money controlled by women, we
            don’t need to be begging on Sand Hill Road.”
